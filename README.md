# CodeAnywhere

If you develop using the [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)
platform, please note that the "**Run Project**" button will serve a
list of files instead of the game. The game itself was moved from
`index.html` to `game.html`. Just click on the file `game.html` and
the game should start.

This video game is under active development by Mountain Elementary
students in Los Alamos, NM. It started as a summer break coding
project in 2018.

You can play the game right here: [**Play Geometry Smash**](game.html)

  with some useful information on how to contribute.
- If you don't want to install any software and start developing
  anyway have a look at
  [GitPod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/video-game-coding-club/geometry-smash)
  as your fully featured IDE (Note that the free plan is limited
  currently to 10 hours of usage per month).

# GitPod

[GitPod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/video-game-coding-club/geometry-smash)
offers tight GitHub integration. All necessary `git` commands can be
run via the GUI instead of the command line. The game itself lives in
`game.html`. Just right-click on the file `game.html` and open it with
the "Mini Browser" and the game should start.

# Online JavaScript Editor

You can use our [online JavaScript
editor](https://video-game-coding-club.github.io/online-editor/) to
develop JavaScript graphics. The editor and game environments are identical so that you simply cut and paste working code from the editor into the game.

# CodeAnywhere

If you develop using the [CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/)
platform, please note that the "**Run Project**" button will serve a
list of files instead of the game. The game itself was moved from
`index.html` to `game.html`. Just click on the file `game.html` and
the game should start.

# More details on where the game lives

The game script was loaded in `index.html` but recently we introduced
a landing page and split the game code into a separate page,
`game.html`.  This change was introduced with commit
[4107049a6ea0ce925b2e28b5087470ea0b4658dd](https://github.com/video-game-coding-club/geometry-smash/commit/4107049a6ea0ce925b2e28b5087470ea0b4658dd)
and the introduction of using GitHub Pages to build our website.

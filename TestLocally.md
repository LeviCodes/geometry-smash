# Test the game locally

If you are using CodeAnywhere or GitPod you can test your changes directly.

## GitPod

Right click on `game.html` and open the file with the "Mini Browser".

## CodeAnywhere

Run the project which will open a new browser tab or window and show
webpage.

## Your own development environment (i.e. your own computer)

If you developing locally you need to install some additional software
to run and preview the game. Since we are using GitHub pages you can
read [how to set up GitHub Pages
locally](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/)

# Preparing your CodeAnywhere system

The default editor in the codeanywhere machine is
[vim](https://www.vim.org/) which has a somewhat unusual user
interface. An easier to use alternative is
[nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) which you will have to install
with:

~~~ Shell
$ sudo apt-get install nano
~~~
